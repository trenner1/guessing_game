## This is a guessing game tutorial from [Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) at Rust-lang.  

I completed this tutorial and learned the various features associated with Rust's cargo module.

Apart from learning some rust specific fundamentals, I picked up some neat tricks:

`rustfmt main.rs` - this will format the named rust file.  Ensure you are in the src directory to use it.

`cargo run` - this will build and then run the program

`cargo check` - this will check if your program will compile

`cargo new hello_world` - this will create a new rust project in your current directory including the src and target directories and the cargo.toml file. 

`rustc main.rs` - this will compile and create a rust binary
